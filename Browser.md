## Eevent object in JavaScript : 
An event is the action that user performs like : typing in an Input, clicking a Button, mouse entering or leaving.
```
onChange={(e) => {
    console.log("Full event object:", e);
    console.log("Input value:", e.target.value);
  }}
```
e: the SyntheticEvent object (Reactâ€™s version)

e.target: the input element

e.target.value: what the user just typed
